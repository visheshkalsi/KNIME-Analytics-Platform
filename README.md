# Data Analysis and Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains two distinct projects demonstrating data analysis, preprocessing, and predictive modeling skills using the KNIME Analytics Platform.

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
- Focused on understanding a demographic dataset through statistical summaries, visualisations, and feature engineering.
- Applied binning, normalisation, discretisation, and binarisation to prepare data for future use.

### Predictive Modeling and Classification:
- Built multiple classifiers (e.g., Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM) to predict the 'QUALIFIED' attribute in a dataset.
- Employed robust preprocessing, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning to optimise model performance.
- Achieved the highest accuracy with a Random Forest model (90.86%).

### Tools:
- KNIME Analytics Platform: Utilised for workflow design, data preprocessing, and model development.
- This repository offers a practical demonstration of data science workflows, with detailed insights available within each project folder.
