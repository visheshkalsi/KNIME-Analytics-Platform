# Data Exploration and Preprocessing Project #
This project involves exploring and preparing a demographic dataset for analysis. Tasks include attribute classification, statistical summarisation, and data preprocessing using various techniques. Key highlights:

### Data Exploration: ###
- Identified attribute types (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio) and summarised their distributions.
- Visualised relationships and patterns using box plots, histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.

### Preprocessing: ###
- Applied binning techniques (equi-width and equi-depth) for price attribute smoothing.
- Normalised data using min-max and z-score methods.
- Discretised year-built data into defined categories (e.g., Very Old, New).
- Binarised categorical variables for analysis.

### Key Insights: ###
- Identified positive correlations (e.g., land area vs. price) and negative correlations (e.g., structural type vs. land area).
- Observed outliers in price data, skewing the dataset.
- The project demonstrates comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preparation skills with a focus on extracting actionable insights.
